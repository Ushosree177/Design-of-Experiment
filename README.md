 Book1 doe.xlsx

This file contains data for a Design of Experiments (DOE) study.
It includes multiple treatments and responses arranged for analysis.
The dataset can be used for computing ANOVA and comparing treatment effects.
It helps understand how different input factors influence the output.
We can clean, visualize, and analyze the data easily using Excel or Python.
Useful for regression, variance analysis, and model building.


LSD.xlsx (Latin Square Design)

This file contains data from a Latin Square Design (LSD) experiment.
LSD controls for row and column effects along with treatments.
The sheet includes rows, columns, treatments, and observed responses.
It is useful for analyzing agricultural or industrial experiments.
ANOVA can be performed to test treatment significance.
Helps remove variability caused by two blocking factors.



factorial experiment.xlsx

This file contains data for a factorial experiment with multiple factors.
It includes different combinations of factor levels (A, B, etc.).
Useful for studying interaction effects between factors.
Supports full factorial ANOVA and effect estimation.
Great for understanding how factors jointly influence output.
Helps in optimization and industrial experiment design.
